# Bike sharing Availability Forecast: The Seoul Case Study

A significant component of modern urban transportation systems is bike sharing. It provides people with a flexible, affordable, and environmentally friendly way to travel short distances.

However, customers often struggle to find a bike when they need oneâ€”especially during peak commute hours or under certain weather conditions. This mismatch between demand and availability not only frustrates users but also causes financial and customer losses for bike share operators.

This project explores forecasting models to predict bike availability in Seoul, helping improve customer satisfaction and optimize operations.
